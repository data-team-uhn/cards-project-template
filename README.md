# CARDS Project Template

This is a template repository for CARDS-based projects. When creating a new project, use this repository as a template, then run `setup.sh` to customize it.

After running the setup script, the codebase will be set up with `backend`, `resources`, and `feature` submodules for your project.

You can add other _resources_, like _questionnaires_, in `resources/src/main/resources/SLING-INF/content/`, Java code in `backend/src/main/java/`, or customize the other _features_ to use in `docker_compose_env.json`.
